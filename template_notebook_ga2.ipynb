    "In this group assignment your team will delve into some deep learning applications for computer vision. The assignment will be delivered in the same groups from *Group assignment 1* and you start from this template notebook. The notebook you submit for grading is the last notebook pinned as default and submitted to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/t/90a3b6380ecb4700857b9e07a44ca41b) prior to the deadline on **Tuesday 20 May 23:59**. Closely follow [these instructions](https://github.com/gourie/kaggle_inclass) for joining the competition, sharing your notebook with the TAs and making a valid notebook submission to the competition. A notebook submission not only produces a *submission.csv* file that is used to calculate your competition score, it also runs the entire notebook and saves its output as if it were a report. This way it becomes an all-in-one-place document for the TAs to review. As such, please make sure that your final submission notebook is self-contained and fully documented (e.g. provide strong arguments for the design choices that you make). Most likely, this notebook format is not appropriate to run all your experiments at submission time (e.g. the training of CNNs is a memory hungry and time consuming process; due to limited Kaggle resources). It can be a good idea to distribute your code otherwise and only summarize your findings, together with your final predictions, in the submission notebook. For example, you can substitute experiments with some text and figures that you have produced \"offline\" (e.g. learning curves and results on your internal validation set or even the test set for different architectures, pre-processing pipelines, etc). We advise you to first go through the PDF of this assignment entirely before you really start. Then, it can be a good idea to go through this notebook and use it as your first notebook submission to the competition. You can make use of the *Group assignment 2* forum/discussion board on Toledo if you have any questions. Good luck and have fun!\n",

    "* This notebook is just a template. Please keep the five main sections, but feel free to adjust further in any way you please!\n",
    "* Clearly indicate the improvements that you make! You can for instance use subsections like: *3.1. Improvement: applying loss function f instead of g*.\n"

    "# 1. Overview\n",
    "This assignment consists of *three main parts* for which we expect you to provide code and extensive documentation in the notebook:\n",
    "* Image classification (Sect. 2)\n",
    "* Semantic segmentation (Sect. 3)\n",
    "* Adversarial attacks (Sect. 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part, you will train an end-to-end neural network for image classification. In the second part, you will do the same for semantic segmentation. For these two tasks we expect you to put a significant effort into optimizing performance and as such competing with fellow students via the Kaggle competition. In the third part, you will try to find and exploit the weaknesses of your classification and/or segmentation network. For the latter there is no competition format, but we do expect you to put significant effort in achieving good performance on the self-posed goal for that part. Finally, we ask you to reflect and produce an overall discussion with links to the lectures and \"real world\" computer vision (Sect. 5). It is important to note that only a small part of the grade will reflect the actual performance of your networks. However, we do expect all things to work! In general, we will evaluate the correctness of your approach and your understanding of what you have done that you demonstrate in the descriptions and discussions in the final notebook."

Also it is a symmetrical architecture featuring encoder-decoder structure with matching levels so all downsampling steps has a corresponding unsampling step.

It can provide better feature presentation because double convolutional block at each level helps learning more robust features.\n",

Encoder has four layers were each of them has double convolutional layer 3x3 with batch normalisation and ReLu activation.

Batch normalisation stabilises training by normalising activations towards to reach mean value close to 0 and variance close to 1. First layer of encoder has 64 filters converting input image 126x128x3 every next doubles number of filters and at the same time it shrinks the spacial resolution. Bottelneck layer is the deeperst part of network and operates on the most abstract data. It  has the resolution of 8x8x512 and the double convolution 3x3 was used to get 1024 channels. Decoder does the same thing as encoder but instead of max pooling it uses transposed convolution for upsampling. Each block starts with upsampling then concatenates the corresponding encoder features and finally applies two 3x3 convolutions. The number of filters shrinks with the growing resolution. Skip connection halps with connection of encoder features with decoder so connect information about context with localisation.\n",

    "Decision about this specific network was based on fact that the U-Net networks gives a bit better representation of shape of the structures. Approach with classic convolutional neural network step by step shrinks the resolution of the representation in each layer which results in getting small feature maps which are good for classifications of whole image. Getting the full segmentation mask from that may affect in not emphasising the curves and the borders of objects may be lost. U-Net with its more complexed architecture that includes encoder and decoder solves this problem a bit. Encoder accts like a bit like classical version of CNN decreasing the resolution and enhances number of channels to get deep semantic context. But on the other hand decoder with each step uses transposition and in implemented case also skip-connection where the feature map from encoder is added to the representation. The network gets  new information in every reconstruction layer about textures or corves which helps in emphasis of contours of the objects.\n"

    "Choosing combination of two training losses emphasises positive aspects of both of them. Mainly the Cross-Entropy focuses on measuring the pixels separetly and at the same time in Dice the overlap of whole spaces. The first one may lose some information about some small object and may not emphasise them properly and the second one adds extra pressure for smaller elements. So combinantion allows for Dice to be aware of small object and Cross-Entropy holds all pixels. With only using Cross-Entropy the segmentation was even more disrupted/blurry but this method converges faster then Dice which allows to mark contours a bit more percise. The used technique of combined losses combines the main features of the methods and allows to better training for notbalanced classes."

    "### DeepLabV3 Explanation\n",
    "The biggest feature of DeepLabV3 is atrous convolution, which skips some pixels during convolution so that the reception field is increased without loss much information like pool. Convolutions in the later several layers in ResNet50 are replaced using atrous convulution, and ResNet50 generates a feature map. The feature map will be further processed by a 1\\*1 convolution kernel, 3 atrous convolution kernels with various rates aiming to capturing features at different abstract level, and a image pooling which compresses the whole image information to a single pixel so that the context information is represented, and the single pixel from the image pooling will be expanded to the same size as the three outputs using bilinear interpolation and then all the channels are concatentated. The concatenated channels go through a 1\\*1 convolution head for fusion the information across channels. The whole structure works as an encoder. \n",

It concatenates the output from DeepLabV3 and early features extracted from early conv layers of ResNet50, then fusion then. The result then goes through several small convolutional layers to produce the last result. \n",

    "### Why choose DeepLabV3 not Plus\n",
    "We actually expect DeepLabV3Plus performs better than DeepLabV3 becuase of its light weight decoder. The reason DeepLabV3Plus is worse is that it can ony be imported from segmentation_models_pytorch, which are pretrained on ImageNet dataset. But models imported from torchvision.models.segmentation are trained on COCO. We think COCO represents a closer distribution of the VOC2009 in this project."

    "In transfer learning of segmentation, we have learned various architectures before exploring them, including FCN, UNet, DeepLabV3, etc. We also practiced transfer learning, which is the mostly used training method. At first we forgot to freeze initial layers, resuling in a much worse result. We also found post processing techniques are helpful. DCRF helps make segmentation boundaries sharper, making results more trust-worthy. Two common scenarios of segmentation include autonomous driving, where segmentation of lanes, objects etc. helps operation system make decisions, and medical domain, like tooth segmentation given a oral CT scan image.\n",
    "\n",
    "When evaluating results, both over segmentation and under segmentaion are observed. Like for a electrical bike image there are multilabels predicted for the bike, and for an image of a woman sitting on a couch many areas are identified as background. The concept of over and under segmentation is introduced in Lecture6. The (D)CRF algorithm is introduced in Lecture7. Lectures10 and 11 help us understand neural networks used here better. And specifically, (weighted) cross entropy and ResNet are introduced in Lecture11.\n",
