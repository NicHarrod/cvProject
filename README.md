## Communication Records

This part record communications within the group, and reveal the progresses.

### Mar. 19th

- The meeting discuss on the assignment

- Agreed on divide work into steps: PCA & handcraft features, classification, optimization

- Agreed on 3 person works on PCA while another 2 on handcraft

- Yao, Zhang and Zhao were assigned to do the PCA part, Aleksandra and Nic were assigned to handcraft part

### Mar. 22nd

- The communication is focus on workload distribution on PCA part

- Yao merged his progress on PCA to code repo, and shown how it works

- Agreed on Yao works on fit code demo into template, Zhao complete a different version of PCA to explore more possibility, and Zhang helps Aleksandra and Nic on handcraft.

### Mar. 25th

- Everyone shared their progress on PCA and handcraft

- Discovered that PCA & handcraft part should not be implemented in individual Python modules, but in the same Jupyter Notebook

- Agreed on merge all progress into a single Jupyter Notebook

- Agreed on Zhao will work on merge progress on PCA and migrate to notebook file, Zhang will work on result evaluation in the future, while rest will be work on classification part
